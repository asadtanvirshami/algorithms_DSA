Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It works by iteratively inserting each element from an unsorted portion of the array into its correct position within the sorted portion of the array.

Here's how the insertion sort algorithm works:

1. Start with the second element (element at index 1) and compare it with the first element (element at index 0).
2. If the second element is smaller, swap it with the first element to ensure that the array is sorted up to this point.
3. Move to the third element (element at index 2) and compare it with the elements to its left, shifting the larger elements one position to the right until the correct position is found.
4. Repeat this process for all the remaining elements in the array, each time inserting the current element into its correct position within the sorted portion of the array.

Insertion sort is an in-place sorting algorithm, which means it sorts the array by rearranging its elements without requiring additional data structures. It has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case and average case, where n is the number of elements to be sorted. However, for small input sizes or nearly sorted arrays, insertion sort can perform efficiently and outperform more complex algorithms.

Insertion sort is important because:

1. Simplicity: It is one of the simplest sorting algorithms to understand and implement. It is easy to code and does not require any advanced data structures or complicated logic.
2. Efficiency for small inputs: Insertion sort performs well for small input sizes or when the array is already partially sorted. It has low overhead and performs fewer comparisons and swaps compared to more complex algorithms.
3. Adaptive: Insertion sort is adaptive, meaning that it efficiently handles input arrays that are already partially sorted. It requires fewer comparisons and swaps in such cases.
4. Online sorting: Insertion sort can be used to sort data as it arrives in real-time. It is an online sorting algorithm because it can continuously update a sorted list as new elements are added.

Insertion sort is commonly used in scenarios where the input size is small or nearly sorted, such as:

1. Partially sorted arrays: When the input array is already partially sorted or contains a small number of elements out of order, insertion sort can efficiently sort the array with minimal overhead.
2. Online sorting: As mentioned earlier, insertion sort can be used for sorting data as it arrives in real-time. It can maintain a sorted list by inserting new elements into their correct positions as they are received.
3. Hybrid algorithms: Insertion sort is often used as part of other more complex sorting algorithms like Timsort, which is used in Python's sorting module. These hybrid algorithms leverage the advantages of insertion sort for small subarrays while using other algorithms for larger portions.
4. Teaching and learning: Due to its simplicity, insertion sort is commonly used as an introductory example for teaching basic sorting algorithms and concepts. It helps beginners understand the fundamentals of sorting before moving on to more advanced algorithms.
